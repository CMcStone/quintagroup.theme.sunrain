Introduction
============

This is a full-blown functional test. The emphasis here is on testing is
after theme installation site will not breaks.

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
us see all error messages in the error_log.

    >>> browser.handleErrors = False
    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and check if after
theme installation everything is rendered correctly. We will
do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)
    >>> print browser.contents
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...
    <h1...>
    Welcome to Plone
    </h1>
    ...
